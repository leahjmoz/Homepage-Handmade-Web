        <h2>Laurel Schwulst</h2>
        <ul class="banner">
            <li>Relevant despite being written in 2018. “In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you.”</li>
            <br>
            <li>Love the continued reference to a website being a house since that was my first instinct as well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>“A website can be anything. It doesn’t (and probably shouldn’t) be an archive of your complete works. That’s going to be dead the moment you publish.” Hard to wrap my head around when everything now requires a digital/online portfolio for jobs… they are super tedious to keep up with though.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Some people even call rain “computer weather.” I’ve never heard this? Not sure what it means, like if it’s raining, you have to stay inside on the computer? Google was no help.</li>
            <br>
            <li>“Puddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would love to see a website evaporate slowly, too.” “What happens to websites after death, anyway?” These two quotes feel connected in my brain in some way.</li>
            <br>
            <li>“The World Wide Web recently turned 29.” Since this was written in 2018, I looked up how old it is now. It turned 36 less than 3 weeks ago! Happy birthday, WWW!! (although some people claim it’s only 34, depending on whether you count its year started or year published)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ursula K. Le Guin</h2>
        <p>“"Technology" and "hi tech" are not synonymous, and a technology that isn't "hi," isn't necessarily "low" in any meaningful sense.” This reminds me of the translation machine project we did last year, where I had to consider “low tech” as a valid form of technology/machines, which I never really had to do before. In this age, it’s hard not to immediately think high-tech when hearing just technology.</p>
    
        <p>Makes me think about this class and the validity of the websites we/I will make and that they are not any “lower” than any other more aesthetic website, theyre all just websites, houses.</p>
